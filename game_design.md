- [ ] make it feel like a real game


## Story ##

- You are friens with a sleepy duck whose bed ot destroyed. It is your duty to help your friend by collecting all the pieces of the bed so that it can sleep 

- alternative: The duck has lost its teddy bear -> without it, it can not sleep

- you have to solve puzzles or fight against enemies to get the bed (or the teddy) -> maybe no fighting at all?
  I generally do notlike fighting and find games without it quite interesting
