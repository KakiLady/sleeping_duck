# sleeping duck #

### What I want to learn in this project ###

- [ ] make a game with a cozy vibe
- [ ] improve pixel art 
- [ ] make music that is going into the direction of classical music
- [ ] make my first "own" game
- [ ] learn how to really design (colour palette, coherent design)
- [ ] create a great itch.io page
- [ ] create a story 
- [ ] make it feel like a real game


### Story ###

- You are friends with a sleepy duck whose bed got destroyed. It is your duty to help your friend by collecting all the pieces of the bed so that it can sleep 

- alternative: The duck has lost its teddy bear -> without it, it can not sleep

- you have to solve puzzles or fight against enemies to get the bed (or the teddy) -> maybe no fighting at all?
  I generally do not like fighting and find games without it quite interesting
